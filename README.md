## Speaker Instructions


[Quick tutorial on adding files to GitHub repos you don't own](https://ardalis.com/how-to-add-files-to-a-github-repo-you-don%E2%80%99t-own/)

Please add your supporting materials for your session in a single file in the "talks" folder. Ideally with no spaces in the filename.

> /talks/your-session-title/your-session-title.pdf

If you'd rather link to your files somewhere else, just add a README with links instead:

> /talks/your-session-title/README.md

Then update the list above with a link to your file (or README) in your talk folder, in alphabetical order if you can. Even if you just include your file, feel free to add a README with your contact info, etc. in the folder as well.

Thanks!
